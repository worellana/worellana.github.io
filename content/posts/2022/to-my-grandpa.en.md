Thursday March 3rd seemed to start as a normal day, until I received a call from my mom at an unusual time, at that moment I knew that something was wrong and indeed something was not right, I started my day with the news that you were no longer physically with us, at that moment I did not know what to say, after processing the news the first thing that came to my mind were the words you said to me when I was going through a bad moment in my life and that hug you gave me, I remembered my childhood years and all the beautiful memories you left behind.

I can say with certainty that the day of your funeral was one of the most difficult days that I have had to live, it is still hard to believe that you are no longer here, that I will no longer hear your voice, that I will no longer hear your laughter and that we will no longer have those conversations, it has taken me a long time to write this, I always start it and leave it unfinished.

The truth is that I can only thank you for all the time we lived together, the good memories, the laughs, the advice that I keep in a very special place in me, _Thank you for so much grandpa_, you will be missed a lot here you can be sure of that, but I will always remember you and a smile will come to me.

So long Grandpa.
