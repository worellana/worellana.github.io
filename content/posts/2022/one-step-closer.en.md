Some time ago I embarked on an adventure, to finish the university, which for certain reasons I did not manage to finish at the time, today with great satisfaction I can say that I am one step closer to achieving that goal, at first it seemed very far away, but time inevitably passes and I am already in pre-specialization, which is the final requirement to graduate.

If everything goes as I expect, at the end of the year I will be posting that I succeed, by the way, the pre-specialization is about computer forensics, a subject that I am not familiar with but that catches my attention and that has been booming lately, so I also hope to post something about what I am learning in this little personal diary.

Until then â€¦

Cheers!!!
