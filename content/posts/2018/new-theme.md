It's been a long time since the last post, but now I want to write, but not just that, I want to change the **look** on the blog.

With that in mind, I had started to look for a minimalist theme and then customized to fit my needs, I have to say that the result is looking great (at least from my point of view)

The theme is [Pickles](https://github.com/mismith0227/hugo_theme_pickles) using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) engine as static site generator, as I said before the look and feel is what I was looking for, so it will pass some time before I decide to change the theme again, hopefully the blog will have more post than this time üòÅ

Regards!
