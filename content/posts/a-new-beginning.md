Honestly, I do not remember exactly how many times, I have started the task of writing a blog, but I always end up throwing it away for many reasons but mainly because I do not have much time to write.

So this day I decided to start blogging again, not because I have more time to write, rather I do it as a personal log where I can capture my thoughts and my experiences in my personal and work life.

In times where writing a blog is no longer so "**fancy**" I will try to keep it updated and add content of the topics that interest me ðŸ™‚

Regards !!
