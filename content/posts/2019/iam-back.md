Apparently always by these same dates I have the desire to write, so here I am promising once again constancy in the blog, this time I have a new personal project that I want to finish, for this I will need a lot of perseverance and discipline, something of which I am aware that I lack a little ðŸ˜‹

Programming has always been one of my passions, and as a child I developed a very special taste for video games, I always dreamed of creating one and I think it is the perfect time to create it, even if this involves learning a lot, since I have no knowledge of As a videogame is made, it will be a project that I will carry out at night and on weekends and therefore it will be something small, I do not have very well defined the idea of the game itself, only that it will be for Android and that the controls are touch , I think I'll take a kind of devlog here, so it will be ideal to give continuity to the blog.

So I hope the blog gets a little more active these days.

Cheers!
